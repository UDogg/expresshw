# CMPSC 297 Homework 3

_Due: February 02, 2023_

In week two of 297 we worked on more complicated JavaScript, via Node.JS. Today,
we'll actually extend this Node.JS structure and utilize a specific library -
Express.JS.

In this week, you'll be making your own Express.JS file server, and have it
serve an HTML file. This is the basis of a website, so you'll effectively be
creating a website from scratch!

The project is not set up for you whatsoever, so you're responsible for making
it from scratch. To aid you, a guide is placed in the `/docs/` folder.

## Deliverables

On top of setting up the project within the `./docs/` folder, you are
responsible for creating one additional route: `/portfolio/`. The route should
be contained within the `./routes/portfolio.js` file.

This route is responsible for returning an HTML page (which may contain CSS, if
you wish). The HTML page should have three projects that you've worked on (you
are allowed to add in any of the homeworks from this class, or any projects from
previous CMPSC classes!)

The page must have:

-   Your name;
-   Three projects, consisting of:
    -   A project title;
    -   A project description;
    -   What programming language(s)/tools you used.
-   A link to your GitHub.

## What you'll be graded on

You'll be graded on having the JavaScript files as instructed, as well as the
correctness of JavaScript files. Ideally, if you can visit all of the routes
listed within your web browser when your application is running, you'll get full
credit.
