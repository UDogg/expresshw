<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
<p>Name: UC Choudhary</p>

</body>
<p>I have a lot of empty repositories with nothing in them because I didn't upload them yet.</p>
<p> In high school I worked a lot with Ruby but we had no version control so I didn't upload anything on GitHub</p>
<p>I took this class to add projects to my GitHub page and have my own decentralized Portfolio website but here are a few half finished projects.</p>
<h1>Project 1: Whack-A-Mole</h1>
<h3>&#x2022; This project was my attempt at creating a python based GUI Whack-A-Mole game with levels and scores.</h3>
